# Teaching Digital Workshops
This is a tutorial on how to design a workshop for teaching digital humanities tools.

## Planning Stage
1. Consider your audience
2. Empathy in Praxis: Remember what it feels like to learn a new tool and design your workshop with the beginner in mind. Remember that some students have little to no experience with digital tools.   
3. Look at previous incarnations of the project, if available. 

## Create a Lesson Plan
1. Prepare a script for yourself: This can mean a full script or just talking points to make sure you stay on track and do not run over on time. 
2. Prepare a slide deck: This isn't always necessary, but can help. When teaching a new tool, different classes/audiences may move at different speeds. Adding extra slides in your deck is a good idea so that you can add to or shorten your lesson based on the class's progress.
3. Prepare a handout for students so they can follow along with your presentation, but also so that they can refer back to it later. It is a good idea to save the handout as a pdf. Include screenshots of the steps if you can. Include any necessary links. 

## 1-2 Days Before the Workshop
1. Have students set up a user account and download any necessary tools or applications ahead of time. Creating log-ins can take up a lot of time that can be spent learning how to use the tool. 
2. Set up a Zoom meeting and send out the invitation/link to the instructor. 
3. Send the instructor or students a pdf of the handout so they can follow along throughout the workshop.

### Tips & Tricks
1. Practice your workshop or tutorial ahead of time. Test your handout and see if it is easy to follow. Ask a friend or colleague to be a beta tester for you. 
2. Present the information in segments. This will allow you to tailor the workshop to the speed at which the students are working.
