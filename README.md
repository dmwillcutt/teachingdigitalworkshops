## Planning Stage
1. Consider your audience
2. Empathy in Praxis: Remember what it feels like to learn a new tool and design your workshop with the beginner in mind. 
3. Look at previous incarnations of the project, if available. 

## Create a Lesson Plan
1. Prepare a script for yourself: This can mean a full script or just talking points to make sure you stay on track and do not run over on time. 
2. Prepare a slide deck: This isn't always necessary, but can help.
3. Prepare a handout for students so they can follow along with your presentation. Save it as a pdf. Include screenshots of the steps if you can. Include any necessary links.

## 1-2 Days Before the Workshop
1. Have students set up a user account and download any necessary tools or applications ahead of time. 
2. Set up a Zoom meeting and send out the invitation/link to the instructor. 
3. Send the instructor or students a pdf of the handout.
